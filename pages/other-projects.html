            <p>
                While researching my previous projects to create this portfolio, I found many interesting, almost lost,
                projects. Here are some simple projects, made in one day or less, that I had videos laying around. My main
                objective here is to showcase more of my procedural trademark.

            <h3>
                Orbit Game
            </h3>

            <div>
                <p>
                    A game where the player must aim the rocket to reach a target by using the gravity of the
                    surrounding heavy bodies. The physics are made from scratch using a Verlet integrator. The main
                    advantage of this method is the determinism it offers. Thus, the rocket will follow perfectly the
                    predicted path which is very cheap to compute.

                <p>
                    Another variant used a dual planet in which the planets were dynamically attracted to each other and
                    rotated around. To say that the generated trajectory was complicated is an understatement. The path
                    could get hyper complex filled with twists and spins. The interesting part is that, no matter how
                    complicated was the calculated path, the prediction was always correctly evaluated. Unfortunately, I
                    do not have a video for this one.

                    Underwater Shooter

                <p>
                    A shooting obstacle for an underwater game, dynamically created and fired.
