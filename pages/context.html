            <p>
                Context is my latest published game, developed at the end of 2022, my sabatical year. The game asks users to guess the missing words from the phrase context.

                The 3D boxes were a clever gimmick that combined a 3D procedural mesh for the wrapping part and a 2D cut-out SDF for the faces, avoiding subdiving the faces to match the vertices of the 3D part.
