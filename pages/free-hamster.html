                An endless runner featuring a hamster that must escape by running while avoiding obstacles. The objective is to reach a high speed so that the cage/circle/track overheats and explode setting the Hamster Free (just to run into the next level). The line to circle transition and the heat coloring were created using Shader Graph.
