                Thanatophobia is a game experience focused on the horror genre. Its artistic reasoning is detailed
                explained <a href="https://repositorio.ufsm.br/handle/1/19425">here</a>. I was not part of the vision process, I was in charge of making it a reality. From a technical viewpoint the game is a multiplayer room (Photon Network) where players and spectators
                interact. The environment is created procedurally using modular corridors and rooms.

                Player were allowed to physically interact with different props, open and close doors. One of the ideas
                was that the exploration of one player could scary another one since the environment was networked.

                Random modular placement of corridors and rooms to create a different scenario in each run. Here is a
                procedural corridor building example:

            <p>
                Spectators could see entities (controlled by players) through the camera, but other players could only
                hear or see actions (opening a door, moving a cup).

                The first prototype version was set in a different static environment. VR was supported in the game:

                At some point, I worked a bit with the materials, creating a procedural one using Material Design:
