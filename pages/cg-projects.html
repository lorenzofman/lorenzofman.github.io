                A pac-man recreation in C using a simple 2D OpenGL wrapper with no support for bitmaps. All geometry is drawn from primitives: rectangles, circles and sectors.

                In this project, bitmaps could be used, but characters on the screen had to be drawn individually. The canvas is divided as a grid and each character must is drawn using a xy index and their ASCII code. Despite the limitation, the input field is fully functional and supports insertion and deletion at any point. The text automatically shifts based on the cursor position which is indicated by a blinking caret. The main challenge of such feature was that there was no masking and no abstractions to help with the text. The application had to define exactly which characters should appear on screen.

                In collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thalissonforte/">Thalisson</a>, we created a Bubble Shooter game using Allegro. The main restriction was that we could not use bitmaps.

                Similar to the input field one, this project was a text editor created from scratch. This time, however, Allegro was used and with it string support.

                A crankshaft renderer created using OpenGL with procedural geometry. The unlit and wireframes versions were also created using a 2D API requiring that the application code managed the camera projection and other matrices transformations.
