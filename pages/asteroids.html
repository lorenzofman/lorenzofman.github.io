                An Asteroids Unity game inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)"> classical</a>. Infinite borders and no meshed created externally. The player, enemies and the asteroids are all procedurally created. The game explores the use of steering behaviors for enemy navigation and efficient infinite space.

            <p>
                Around the player an imaginary circle is used to determine which objects are too far away and should be recycled by the object poo√ß. This process is lazily, verifying only a fixed amount of objects per frame to maintain efficiency.
