                Enemy Territory - Remake
            </h1>

            <p>
                Since I started coding I dream about being able to pull off a remake of the classical Wolfenstein -
                Enemy Territory. Unfortunately, the amount of artistic work to be done exceeds my abilities. During the
                years I gave this project a few shots and with them I always learned something new.

                Here is some weapon procedural animation (except the reload animation) that I created for the MP40 model

                This project also led me to study and compare character creation programs. Here is one my
                characters for the game.
