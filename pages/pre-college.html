                I started coding in Scratch when I was 12. Shortly after, I shifted my focus towards learning Unity.

                A few key moments are still in my memory. Back then, you could code using Unity's recommendation,
                UnityScript (a
                Javascript-like language), C# or Boo. Unity 4 was a big deal with the Animator being one of the most
                important
                features. The ability to zoom in or out, however, took way longer to arrive. It was required to use two
                monitors: one for the animator and one for everything else.

                By the age of 16 I published my first mobile game to the Google Play store: Insane Rings. Following it,
                a
                handful of other titles were published as well.
