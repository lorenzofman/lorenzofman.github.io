                A Unity game project focused on the creation of a platform character that feels good to play. The project main idea is centered around a ninja that must collect relics and securely return them to the level start. In order to do so, the player must carefully plan his path to ensure that it is viable to return.

                Beyond the character controller, different platform behaviors and a verlet integrator were used to create some of the dynamic elements. A sensei character was also prototyped to lip sync some antique wisdom.
